Question 1: Multi-file Reasoning
What is Cursor's multi-file reasoning and why is it useful?

Answer: Cursor AI can handle many files same time. It is context aware and that is very important because... it is important to understand the context when creating features and a feature can depend on many files.

Question 2: Good Task Prompts

Provide 1-2 examples of well-phrased prompts you would use with Cursor AI. Explain what makes these prompts effective.

Answer: "Create function to compare version numbers digit by digit, not alphabetical order. Version number is a string formatted like x.x.x. For example 1.10.0 is greater than 1.2.9. There can be also fourth hotfix digit but 1.10.0 is still cretater than 1.2.9.1"
The prompt is effective because there is enough information to implement what is needed.

Question 3: Debugging Workflow
What is your workflow when debugging an error with Cursor?

Answer: I will tell exactly what went wrong and give more information for solution. After that I verify that the code works as designed.

Question 4: Personal Benefits
What is the biggest benefit of AI-assisted coding for you personally?

Answer: AI tools creates routines a lot faster than I manually. It also finds suitable technologies for developing way easier than searching npm registry etc. For new programming languages I can skip the hello world syntax learning.
